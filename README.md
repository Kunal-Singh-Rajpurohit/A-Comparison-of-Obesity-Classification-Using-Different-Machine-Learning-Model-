Used all ML Model for prediction

 Obesity level estimation using data analysis and
machine learning is a critical area of research in tackling the
global obesity epidemic. The application of these techniques in
predicting and understanding obesity levels. By analyzing our
dataset and employing machine learning algorithms, accurate
estimations of obesity levels can be achieved.

The study involves preprocessing and analyzing the dataset
to identify key features associated with obesity. Various machine
learning model are utilized to build predictive models for obesity
levels. Through rigorous evaluation and fine-tuning of these
models, accurate predictions can be made.

The results showcase the effectiveness of data analysis and
machine learning in estimating obesity levels. By identifying
influential factors, insights can be gained into the complex
nature of obesity. This knowledge aids in developing targeted
interventions, personalized treatment plans, and preventive
strategies to combat obesity.

Overall, the utilization of data analysis and machine
learning in obesity level estimation holds great promise for
addressing this significant public health issue. The results of
this study aid in the comprehension and treatment of obesity,
thereby enhancing the general health and quality of life for
those who condition.
